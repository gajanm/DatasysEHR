These are the files for History of Present Illnesses Module that I worked on at my summer internship at Datasys Consulting and Software.

The ECO-EHR Application HPI Module allows users such as medical practitioners, medical students, and doctors to add specific medical data about the patient such as infectious diseases, psychiatric problems, neurological problems, eye problems, ear problems, etc. 

The sequence flow of the back-end consists of 5 layers to communicate with the database and retrieve info: 
  Controller layer
  Service layer
  Service implementation layer
  Repository Layer
  Entity Layer
